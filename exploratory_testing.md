###Exploratory testing

[111 RR Book Club][1]: Explore It! with Elisabeth Hendrickson

"I consider the separation of QA from software development to be one of the worst wrong turns that our industry has made because it led to incredibly long feedback cycles."

"It is a practice of simultaneously designing little tests and running those little experiments to learn how the software behaves and using your observations about how the software behaves to design your next little tests all to steer towards the risks in your software. So, rather than confirming that it does what you intended it to do, discover ways in which it violates expectations or does really bad things."
